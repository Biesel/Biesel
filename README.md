 <summary><h3>My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I first started coding with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, with the help of courses and a website called Freecodecamp.org I got the fundamentals to begin my journey as a front-end web developer, first I started doing tiny projects with this stack, projects like a calculator and a  chess are examples of apps made by these technologies.
  After a while I started learning React, SASS and Angular where the majority of web apps that I've developed are written in these languages, projects like my portfolio, a mine sweeper and a todo list app were made with these frameworks. Also, I've learned Three.JS a library for creating web apps with beautiful 3D models with the objective of enhancing the style of my websites.   
  Some time later, due to the emphasis of OOP in University, I started learning programming languages like C#, Java, Kotlin and C++ for software development, some of my projects made by this langauges are a compiler, an inventory management software, a movie booking software, an OpenGL renderer and a workout journal mobile app.
  In the meantime I learned new things with OPP languages, I began to study back-end technologies like Node.js, .NET, Spring Boot and Ruby on Rails. I used some of these frameworks to develop a variety of projects like  a expense tracker, a blog, a forum, a food ordering web app and a e-commerce website. 
  As of today, I continue to expand my knowledge learning other programming languages like Rust and Go, while deepening my skills with the use of websites like CodeWars, CodeForces and Leetcode for improving my problem solving skills and understanding of the programming languages I use.
